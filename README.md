# Nimbler

Nimbler is a GTK-based window switcher. It can be activated with a hotkey, upon which it shows you a list of open windows ordered by workspace. You can switch quickly to the desired window using the shortcut displayed in front of the window. Workspaces can be activated using `F1` through `F12`. The list of windows also allows clicking and navigation with the arrow keys.
